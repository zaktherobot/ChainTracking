# ChainTracking
A lua-based OpenKH mod to track the number of item in a chain you've collected (locking items).

## Instructions
- Add `zaktherobot/ChainTracking` as an OpenKH mod.
- When you run the game, the lua will create a `chain_count.txt` in your game's folder (where the KH2 exe is, similar to autosave). 
- Create an OBS source that reads that file to display it to your stream.
